Ragging is a disturbing reality in the higher education system of our country.
<br>Despite the fact that over the years ragging has claimed hundreds of innocent lives
 and has ruined careers of thousands of bright students, the practice is still perceived by many
 as a way of ‘familiarization’ and an ‘initiation into the real world’ for young college-going students.
<br>Other organisations/bodies working in this field have also attempted to define ragging, the variety
 of definitions being reflective of differences in perspective.
